# Buy Back the Knowledge of the Truth with the Global Compendium

### or ... The Global Compendium, powered by Biibaq

A [compendium](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/compendium) is...

"A short but complete account of a particular subject, esp. in the form of a book"
    - The Caimbridge Dictionary

The compendium here is a bit different. This compendium is a collection of practical guides
in a hierarchical structure with the greatest detail found at the leaves, and the 
branches being more general entries with more references to external resources.
Many of the branches will terminate outside of the compendium itself, leading to 
resources elsewhere, to be consumed by the reader.

The compendium is a living document comprised of the information found elsewhere by the authors.
It is a testament to the authors frustration at the prospects of finding honest, unbiased, and 
useful information in the current era of the internet age (the compendium project launched in 2025 A.D - We know there's another timescale and we don't care for it for reasons which will explained either in the Compendium, or in a related work with the working title: Opinions of the Authors of the Compendium).

The compendium is meant to be a sparse tree. The authors will not rush to fill it with fluff.
Instead, the compendium will be populated with opinions and factual information (each labelled
as such) gleaned from the authors experience and education, with the goal of citing substantiating
evidence from reputable sources and stating the confidence, source, and nature of the information
sourced. In short, I'll tell you my opinions, but I will also tell you that they are opinions,
and I will often cite countering views, although will not likely cite them as heavily. And I will
state facts as facts, with citations where applicable.

The compendium is the application of Biblical thought, applied with broad curiosity, to the 
questions of modern life.
